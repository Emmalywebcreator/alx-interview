Dynamic Programming - Coin Change Problem for a visual and step-by-step explanation of the dynamic programming approach.
By thoroughly understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be well-prepared to tackle the coin change problem. You will need to decide whether a greedy algorithm suffices for your particular set of coin denominations or if a more comprehensive dynamic programming approach is necessary to ensure correctness and efficiency. This project not only tests algorithmic skills but also reinforces the importance of choosing the right strategy based on problem constraints.

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
If total is 0 or less, return 0
If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
Your solution’s runtime will be evaluated in this task
